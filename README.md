# Implementation-of-Message-authentication---Authentication-tied-to-ciphertext
Message authentication is crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data. Tying authentication to ciphertext involves verifying the integrity of the encrypted message.

One common approach is to use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or a cryptographic hash function. Let me break down the process:

## Encrypt the Message:

Use a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES to encrypt the message. This results in ciphertext.
## Generate a MAC:

Compute a MAC using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., HMAC - Hash-based Message Authentication Code) or a dedicated MAC algorithm. The MAC is calculated over the ciphertext and a secret key.
Send the Ciphertext and MAC:

## Transmit the ciphertext along with the MAC to the receiver.
## Verify at the Receiver:

Upon receiving the ciphertext and MAC, the receiver recalculates the MAC using the received ciphertext and the shared secret key.
Compare MACs:

Compare the recalculated MAC with the received MAC. If they match, it indicates that the ciphertext has not been tampered with.
This process ensures that not only is the message encrypted, but there's also a mechanism to verify its integrity. Even if an attacker intercepts and modifies the ciphertext, they won't be able to generate a valid MAC without the secret key.
